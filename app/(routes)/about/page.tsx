          I&apos;ve always been a tinkerer at heart but it wasn&apos;t until
          midway through my sophomore year of college where I found myself

          Moving forward, I taught myself the fundamentals of basic web
          development while simultaneously working as a professional musician. I
          used an old PHP framework to build a fan community and collected and
          stored the fan data in a MSQL database. Years later, the band was

          I was continuously updating and revamping the site, mostly focusing on
          frontend as the backend didn&apos;t change much once it was set up.
